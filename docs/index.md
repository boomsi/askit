# askit Documentation

Welcome to the askit documentation.

**askit** is a UI component library and API layer built on top of [keel](https://github.com/GoAskAway/keel). Through package.json conditional exports, the same `import { StepList, Toast } from 'askit'` delivers real React Native components on the Host side and string identifiers on the Guest side (which keel passes to Host for rendering).

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **keel** | Sandbox-isolated dynamic UI rendering engine — runs React code in isolated JS sandbox (QuickJS/JSC), serializes render operations into instructions, sends them to Host for real React Native rendering |
| **askit** | UI components and API layer on top of keel — provides business components (StepList, ChatBubble, etc.) and cross-boundary APIs (EventEmitter, Toast, Haptic) |
